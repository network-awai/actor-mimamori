  "mimamori offer-matching cell (ADR-2606112300 §D4) — Clojure port of `methods/match.py`.

  誰の保持者でもない人間を作らない — the matching cell reaches each unkept roster
  member DIRECTLY with one covenant offer at a time, never via a public list:

    G5  no global person view leaves this namespace — the returned summary is
        aggregate-only (counts); the offers themselves exist as bond datoms,
        visible to their two parties (G4) and no one else.
    G3  cooldown respected (a declined offer rests); an offer is an OFFER —
        the matched member may decline or ignore it, penalty-free.
    cap each keeper carries at most `max-kept` active+offered bonds — keeping is
        covenant, not a queue (Wellbecoming §1.13); the relay exists so that no
        keeper becomes a sleepless center (D3).

  Deterministic: candidates are sorted; assignment is round-robin over the
  least-loaded willing keepers. No wall clock, no randomness."
