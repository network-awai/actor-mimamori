(ns mimamori.methods.kotoba
  "mimamori 見守り kotoba Datom-log writer. ADR-2606112300 + ADR-2605312345.
  Clojure port of `methods/kotoba.py`.

  Canonical state is the kotoba Datom log (root CLAUDE.md substrate boundary):
  content-addressed EAVT assertions, append-only. This module is mimamori's write
  path onto that log, mirroring the shionome pattern (ADR-2606091000): each
  transaction is content-addressed (sha256 over its canonical datoms + the
  previous tx's CID -> a commit-DAG); a tamper of any earlier tx breaks every
  later CID.

    - bond-datoms     -> EAVT assertions from a replayed Mishmeret engine
    - coverage-datoms -> AGGREGATE-ONLY coverage assertions (G5: counts, no DID)
    - make-tx / tx-cid -> a content-addressed transaction (links prev CID)
    - append-tx        -> append ONE transaction line (never rewrites)
    - read-log / head-cid / verify-chain -- read back + verify the DAG

  The content-addressed commit-DAG primitives (tx-cid / make-tx / append / read /
  verify, byte-compatible with Python) are the actor's shared `kotoba.datom`
  sibling, reused verbatim (NOT re-inlined) and re-exposed here under the same
  names `methods/kotoba.py` defines, so callers depending on either surface work.

  EAVT = [:db/add entity attribute value] -- :db/add only (no retract; exit is
  itself an appended state datom). Deterministic (caller supplies tx-id + as-of)."
